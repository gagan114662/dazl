# File PR

Before filing, check whether a PR for this branch already exists. Review the
diff locally against the base branch (usually `origin/main`) to make sure its
contents match the goal.

PR titles usually become commit messages, so follow the repository's title
conventions. Look at recently merged PRs and Git history for examples. Prefer a
concise, human-readable title that explains why the change matters:

BAD

> ❌ perf(server): negotiate permessage-deflate on the websocket

GOOD

> ✅ perf(server): cut websocket frame size by 70%+ with gzipping

In dazl, also keep the open-PR limit (at most two of yours at a time), and make the description say what
`docs/PROCESS.md` asks of every branch: what changed, the exact claims, what is NOT verified, and how to test it (the
commands and their output). Add the council result from the `council` skill.

Open the description with a simple explanation of the problem based on the
user's original prompt, then briefly explain the solution. Do not lead with an
implementation inventory:

BAD

> ❌ Removed implicit workspace carry-over from every "new thread" entry point (cmd+n / cmd+shift+o, sidebar v1/v2 buttons, command palette). New threads inherit only the project from context; branch, worktree, and env mode always come from the configured defaults. Deleted buildContextualThreadOptions, startNewThreadInProjectFromContext, and the v1 sidebar's seed-context machinery.

GOOD

> ✅ My "new worktree" default was ignored when starting new threads on existing worktrees. Super unintuitive. Now your preferences always apply.

Do not name a model anywhere in the title, description, commits or comments: dazl keeps model identifiers out
of commits and PRs. End the description with the attribution line the harness or session requires (in Claude Code
on the web it supplies one); otherwise name the harness, for example `Created with Claude Code.`

Before submission, check the title, description, quotes, and attachments for
secrets and private details.

Open a real PR rather than a draft so review bots run. If `gh pr create` fails
because the GraphQL rate limit is used up, open it through REST with
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls -f title=... -f head=... -f base=... -F body=@<file>`. If the user also asked
to babysit it, continue with the `babysit-pr` skill.

Do not post a follow-up PR comment unless it serves the user's request. When a
comment is needed, use the `leaving-pr-comments` skill.
